## The Letters of the Alphabet

**The First Letter, A**
The letter A is derived from the Phoenician letter alephâ€”a western Semitic word referring to the aforementioned beast of burden. Aleph can be traced back to the Middle Bronze Age and the Proto-Sinaitic script found in parts of Egypt and Canaan from around 1850 BCE (Before the Common Era).
